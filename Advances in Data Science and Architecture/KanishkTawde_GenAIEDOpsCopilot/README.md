# 📘 1. Project Overview

Emergency Departments (EDs) operate under constant uncertainty due to fluctuating patient arrivals, staffing limitations, and unpredictable surges in demand. Although time-series forecasting is routinely applied in healthcare operations, the insights produced by these models are often highly technical and difficult for non-expert hospital leaders to interpret.

The **GenAI ED Ops Copilot** bridges this operational gap by integrating:

- **SARIMAX forecasting** for short-term ED demand prediction  
- **Generative AI (Mistral)** for natural-language interpretability  
- **An interactive Streamlit application** for real-time exploration and Q&A  

This system transforms raw numerical forecasts into **clear, actionable insights** designed to support decision-making in Emergency Departments.

# 🎯 2. Project Goals

### **Forecasting**
- Predict daily ED patient volumes using SARIMAX with weekly seasonality.

### **Interpretability**
- Generate natural-language explanations summarizing:
  - Historical trends
  - Forecast patterns  
  - Model uncertainty  
  - Accuracy metrics  

### **Interactive Q&A**
- Allow ED managers to ask open-ended questions such as:
  - “Which days will be highest risk?”
  - “What staffing adjustments should we make next week?”  

### **User Interface**
- Provide a Streamlit web interface so users can:
  - Upload ED visit data  
  - Visualize trends and forecasts  
  - Generate explanations  
  - Ask questions to an AI assistant  

### **Responsible AI**
- Use only synthetic, non-PHI data.  
- Ensure LLM outputs remain grounded in model context.  
- Promote human-in-the-loop decision-making.

# 🖥️ 7. Application Workflow

### **7.1 Data Upload**
Users may:
- Upload a CSV file containing daily ED visit counts  
- Or load provided synthetic data  

### **7.2 Historical Visualization**
The app produces:
- Time-series line plot  
- Day-of-week bar chart  
- Basic descriptive statistics  

### **7.3 Forecasting Module**
SARIMAX generates:
- 30-day forecasts  
- Confidence intervals  
- Highlighted risk periods  

### **7.4 Model Evaluation**
The system displays:
- MAE  
- RMSE  
- MAPE  
- Actual vs Predicted curves  

### **7.5 AI-Generated Explanation**
Mistral AI produces:
- Summaries of historical patterns  
- Forecast interpretation  
- Capacity impact insights  
- Staffing recommendations  

### **7.6 Manager Q&A**
Users ask natural-language questions such as:
> “Which days next month require extra staffing?”  
> “How reliable is the forecast for next week?”  

The system answers based strictly on model outputs + context.

# 📈 8. Outputs Produced

### ✔ Forecast Plots  
Visual forecast with confidence intervals.

### ✔ Performance Metrics  
MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.

### ✔ LLM Explanations  
Human-friendly summaries including operational perspective.

### ✔ Interactive Q&A

# 🧪 9. Testing & Validation

### **Model Validation**
- Tested on a 30-day holdout period  
- Achieved **MAPE ≈ 5%**  
- Accurately captured weekly seasonality  

### **LLM Validation**
- Responses constrained to provided context  
- Outputs verified for clarity, correctness, and lack of hallucination  
- Focus on operational relevance  

---

# ⚖️ 10. Ethical Considerations

- All data used is synthetic and non-identifiable  
- No real patients, hospitals, or PHI  
- LLM outputs restricted to model-derived context  
- Tool is positioned as *decision support*, not autonomous decision-making  
- Encourages human oversight  

---

# 🧭 11. Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

- Integrate external features like weather, flu season, holidays  
- Extend forecast horizon using hybrid LSTM models  
- Add anomaly detection for ED surges  
- Deploy to Streamlit Cloud for public use  
- Implement staffing optimization recommendations  
- Add RAG-based retrieval for operational policies
